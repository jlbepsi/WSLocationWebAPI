variables:
  # 1) Name of directory where restore and build objects are stored.
  OBJECTS_DIRECTORY: 'obj'
  # 2) Name of directory used for keeping restored dependencies.

  # 3) A relative path to the source code from project repository root.

  GIT_DEPTH: "0"  # Tells git to fetch all the branches of the project, required by the analysis task


# ### Define global cache rule
# With global cache rule, cached dependencies will be downloaded before every job
# and then unpacked to the paths as specified below.
cache:
  # Per-stage and per-branch caching.
  key: "$CI_JOB_STAGE-$CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG"
  paths:
    # Specify three paths that should be cached:
    #
    # 1) Main JSON file holding information about package dependency tree, packages versions,
    # frameworks etc. It also holds information where to the dependencies were restored.
    - '$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/project.assets.json'
    # 2) Other NuGet and MSBuild related files. Also needed.
    - '$SOURCE_CODE_PATH$OBJECTS_DIRECTORY/*.csproj.nuget.*'
    # 3) Path to the directory where restored dependencies are kept.
    - '$NUGET_PACKAGES_DIRECTORY'
  #
  # 'pull-push' policy means that latest cache will be downloaded (if it exists)
  # before executing the job, and a newer version will be uploaded afterwards.
  # Such a setting saves time when there are no changes in referenced third-party
  # packages.
  #
  # For example, if you run a pipeline with changes in your code,
  # but with no changes within third-party packages which your project is using,
  # then project restore will happen quickly as all required dependencies
  # will already be there — unzipped from cache.

  # 'pull-push' policy is the default cache policy, you do not have to specify it explicitly.
